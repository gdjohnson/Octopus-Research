### Epigraph

“The demand for continuity has, over large tracts of science, proved itself to possess true prophetic power. We ought therefore ourselves sincerely to try every possible mode of conceiving the dawn of consciousness so that it may not appear equivalent to the irruption into the universe of a new nature, non-existent until then.”

- Wiliam James, _The Principles of Psychology_, 1890

### Meetings across the tree of life

> An octopus’s eye is similar to ours. It is formed like a camera, with an adjustable lens that focuses an image on a retina. The eyes are similar but the brains behind them are different on almost every scale”

> James wanted to understand how consciousness came to inhabit the universe. He had an evolutionary orientation to the issue, in a broad sense that included not just biological evolution but the evolution of the cosmos as a whole. He thought that we need a theory based on continuities and comprehensible transitions; no sudden entrances or jumps.

### From white noise to consciousness

> Consciousness surely did not, James said, suddenly irrupt into the universe fully formed. The history of life is a history of intermediates, shadings-off, and gray areas

> There’s a smooth transition from minimal kinds of sensitivity to the world to more elaborate kinds, and no reason to think in terms of sharp divides

Evolution as a continuous function

> gradualist

> Sentience comes before consciousness

> Sentience is brought into being somehow from the evolution of sensing and acting; it involves being a living system with a point of view on the world around it

> there’s the evolution of new kinds of connection between these activities, especially connections that loop, that involve feedback

> A video camera is attached to a pad that sits on the blind person’s skin (for example, on their back). Optical images picked up by the camera are transformed into a form of energy (vibrations, or electrical stimulation) that can be felt on the skin. After some training with this device, the wearers start to report that the camera gives them an experience of objects located in space, not just a pattern of touches on their skin. If you are wearing such a system and a dog walks past, for example, the video system will make a moving pattern of presses or vibrations on your back, but under some circumstances this will not be experienced as vibrations on your back; instead you’ll experience an object moving out in front of you. This happens, though, only when the wearer is able to control the camera, to act and influence the incoming stream of stimulation. The user of the device has to be able to move the camera closer, change its angle, and so on. The simple way to do this is to attach the camera to the person’s body. Then the wearer can make objects loom, and come and go[…]

> simple task with one eye masked, then each pigeon was tested on the same task while being forced to use the other eye. In a study using nine birds, eight of them did not show any “inter-ocular transfer at all. What seemed to be a skill learned by the whole bird was in fact available to only half the bird; the other half had no idea

> The special kind of mental fragmentation seen in split-brain humans seems to be a routine part of many animals’ life

> slosh the incoming information around

> They think that the activity in our brains that leads to visual experience is the building of a coherent “inner model of the world

> I think that Milner and Goodale are suggesting that it feels like nothing. There is no experience here because the machinery of vision in frogs is not doing the sorts of things it does in us that give rise to subjective experience

> When we think of simpler animals as having subjective experience, according to this view, we’re projecting onto them a fainter version of our own kind of experience. This is a mistake because our experience relies on features they just don’t possess

> you think that those things (pain, shortness of breath, etc.) only feel like something because of sophisticated cognitive processing in mammals that has arisen late in evolution? I doubt it

> Instead, it seems plausible that an animal might feel pain or thirst without having an “inner model of the world, or sophisticated forms of memory.

> Sentience has some point to it. It’s not just a

> bathing in living activity.

> Perceptual constancies show that an animal is perceiving external objects as external objects—as objects that can stay the same while the animal’s vantage point changes

### Making colors

> even if cephalopods have hidden powers of color perception, a lot of their wild chromatic output is surely lost on watchers. The baboons, on the other hand, can say hardly anything. Their channel of communication is very limited. But they hear much more.

> Evolution is not heading anywhere, not toward us or anyone else. But I can’t resist seeing, in both animals, an unfinished quality. They are both animals with a one-sidedness in their version of the fundamental signaling duality, the interlocking roles of sender and receiver, producer and interpreter

### Our Minds and Others

> He tried to find some enduring presence, a permanent and stable being which persists through the jumbled flow of experience. He claimed he could find no such thing

> A person is just a bundle or collection of images and feelings

> continued use and advancement of this power [of speech] would have reacted on the mind by enabling and encouraging it to carry on long trains of thought

> She looked at when children become able to use a logical principle called the disjunctive syllogism. Suppose you know that either A or B is true. Then you learn not A, so you should conclude B. Can children follow this rule before they have the word “or in their vocabulary? For a while it was thought that they could, but now it seems they need to have learned the word before they can do this sort of mental processing

> How is the word made flesh

> When you move your head or shift your gaze, the image on your retina continually changes, but this is not perceived as a change in the objects around you

> With an efference copy mechanism, as you decide to act, sending a “command of some sort to your muscles, you also send a faint image of the same command (a “copy of it, in a rough sense of that term

> this creates the problem of distinguishing when a change in what is perceived is due to something important happening outside, and when it is due to the animal’s own actions

> Within a terminology used by Daniel Kahneman and other psychologists, it’s a means for System 2 thinking. This is a slow, deliberate style of thinking we engage in when we encounter novel situations, as opposed to the rapid System 1 thinking that makes use of habits and intuitions

> System 2 thinking tries to follow proper rules of reasoning, and tries to look at things from more than one side

> Inner speech seems to be an important part of System 2 thinking. It is a way of walking through the consequences of actions, a way to bring reasons to bear against temptation

> In an experiment done in 2001, people were told to listen to featureless random noise through a set of headphones, and were told that the song “White Christmas might occasionally be played very quietly through the noise

See Clark snow-turd example

> The usual interpretation of the experiment is that the subjects in the experiment imagined the tune they were supposed to listen for, and sometimes mistook their own auditory image for a genuine playing of the song

> Inner speech is apparently one of a family of tools that enable complex thought in us

> You can be sitting motionless, watching an unchanging scene, and your mind can be alive with this stuff, teeming with it in a great jumble. Inner speech is so subjectively prominent, for many people, that it can be overwhelming; the endless chatter is something people use meditation to get away from

> second-generation version of the workspace theory was defended by the French neurobiologists Stanislas Dehaene and Lionel Naccache in 2001

> For Dehaene and Naccache, the function of conscious thought is to make it possible for us to do novel, deliberate actions that require us to take the “big picture into account

> Baars, Dehaene, and Naccache also talk about a kind of broadcast when describing how consciousness works: broadcasting information throughout the brain is what makes that information conscious

> As most animals are very unlikely to have higher-order thought, the result is an extreme example of what I called a latecomer view of subjective experience

> Perhaps the most vivid of all forms of conscious thought are those in which we bring attention to bear on our own thought processes, reflect on them, and experience them as our own

> However language arose, its appearance changed the course of human evolution. By some path that we can presently only speculate about, language was also internalized; it became part of the machinery of thought

> Cell-cell signaling was used to build multicellular animals, and within some of them a new control device arose: the nervous system

> The nervous system arose through one internalization of sensing and signaling, and the internalization of language as a tool for thinking was another

> Reafference makes perception more ambiguous. If your own actions did not alter what your senses pick up, life would be easier in some ways

> One way to deal with the problem is with the “efference copy mechanisms I described earlier. As you move, you send a signal to the parts of yourself that deal with perception, telling them to ignore some of what comes in: “Don’t worry, that’s just me

> Back in chapter 2 I also discussed two different roles that communication between individuals can have, roles that map onto different views of what the first nervous systems were doing for their owners. One role is to coordinate what is perceived with what is done; this is the role exemplified by Paul Revere’s lantern code. The other role is to coordinate different components of a single action, such as when a person “calls the stroke in a rowboat

> If inner speech is a kind of broadcasting of information in the brain, it resembles the loop of reafference seen when you talk aloud to yourself or write notes to yourself. But this time the loop is tighter and more confined, invisible rather than public, a field for free and silent experiment

> The human case—an extreme case—suggests that the opportunities associated with reafference help to drive the evolution of a more complicated mind. Cephalopods are on a different road

### Experience Compressed

> Giant cuttlefish, these large and complicated animals, have very short lives: just one or two years

> Cephalopods are evolution’s only experiment in big brains outside of the vertebrates

> On mountainsides in California and Nevada there are pine trees that were alive when Julius Caesar was wandering around Rome

> If you keep replacing the parts of an automobile with new ones, there is no reason why it should ever stop running

> At the level of cells there is the possibility of indefinite renewal. But something about the kinds of objects we are—the kinds of collections of cells we are—gives us and other animals a relation to aging that is different from that of other living things

> Why do hummingbirds live till they are ten, rockfish till they are two hundred, bristlecone pines till they are thousands of years old, and octopuses until they are two?

> Perhaps old individuals die off because this benefits the species as a whole, by saving resources for the young and vigorous

> Suppose we had a population in which the old do graciously > pass the baton at some appropriate time, but an individual appeared who did not sacrifice himself in this way, and just kept going. This one seems likely to have the chance to have a few extra offspring. If his refusal to sacrifice was also passed on in reproduction, it would spread, and the practice of sacrifice would be undermined

> Evolution produces what is called a mutation-selection balance with respect to many genes

> A mutation-selection balance is a situation where bad mutations of a gene are being weeded out just as quickly as they are being introduced

> But hardly anyone lives long enough for this fact to make a difference. So the > selection pressure against a late-acting harmful mutation is very slight. When molecular accidents put mutations into the population, as described above, the late-acting mutations will be cleaned out less efficiently than early-acting ones.

> So mutations with good effects early in life and bad effects late in life will accumulate; natural selection will favor them. Once many of these have arisen in the population, and all or nearly all individuals carry some of them, a decay late in life will come to seem preprogrammed. Decay will appear in each individual as if on a schedule, though each individual will show the effects a bit differently.

> I’ve introduced the two main ideas behind the evolutionary theory of aging. In the 1960s the theory was made rigorous and precise when the English evolutionary theorist William Hamilton turned his huge mind toward the problem.

> As a result, they have ended up with their unusual combination: a very large nervous system and a very short life. They have the large nervous system because of what those unbounded bodies make possible and the need to hunt while being hunted; their lives are short because their vulnerability tunes their lifespan.
